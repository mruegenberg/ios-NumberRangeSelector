Granular selection from a numeric range for iOS.

## Installation
There will be a Cocoapod soon. Until then, simply copy the `.h` and `.m`  files into your project, and either install the `objc-utils` Cocoapod or copy the `UIColor+HelperAdditions` and `NSObject+ObserveActions` categories into your project.
